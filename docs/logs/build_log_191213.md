   ## Observations
    
   * Drone flies well, much more stable than before (Success!)
   * Power cable needs to be shortened to keep away from props
   
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Rewired the system while improving cable management, and attached the camera mounts and feet.
   * Attachted receiver to underside of top plate for improved weight distribution.
   * Adjusted throttle curve for improved 
   * A CAD file for a battery mount was created.

   
   ## Next Steps
   
   * Take off mode for easy start-up? Maybe a certain input lifts the drone a few feet off the ground and hovers in place.
   * POV Camera for better flight control and prescision 
   * Additional calibration and weight distribution adjustments
   * Zipties
   * Shorten power cable.
   * Obtain proper standoffs to mount the flight controller to the frame (currently taped down).
   * The battery mount needs to be optimized and 3D-printed.
