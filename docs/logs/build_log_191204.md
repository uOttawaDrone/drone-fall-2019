   ## Observations
 
   * The drone seems self-stablizing
   
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Arming command was bound to no throttle, yaw right.
   * The drone now seems flight ready but we would need better weather conditions to fly it or a dedicated local and pilot as to not put anyone in danger.
   
   ## Next Steps
   
   * Fly the drone
